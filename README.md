conkyrss
========

Yet another rss reader for conky.  This one will fetch RSS only when conky is running.  I delete the RSS data when X starts up via a startup script, so it always starts fresh.  

This script will read a list of RSS URLs in the ~/.rss/rsslinks file.  It will step through them sequentially from top to bottom.
